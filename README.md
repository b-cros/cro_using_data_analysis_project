AI immersive Bootcamp final project: Conversion Rate Optimization Using Data Analysis.
As a marketer I want to solve a really common issue for any company that does digital marketing advertising: the conversion rate optimization.
Using a dataset of a Brazilian marketplace, the analysis has 3 KPI's: 
Where: to find out where the best sellers are, which delivery timing.
When: during which season do the sellers sell more?
What: which type of products are the top sales?
This analysis is a preparation for a better segmentation for a marketing team and also a preparation for a machine learning linear regression model, 
in order to predict which dealers will sell more.
